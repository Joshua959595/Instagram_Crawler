# Instagram_Crawler
Web_Crawling program for Instagram in Python environment.

1st file saves the Instagram data (id, context, likes, place, hashtags) in Excel form.
2nd file makes whole hastag data in a list and count the hashtag in descending order.
3rd file saves the image from Instagram. But, it is very incomplete yet. I made this program before I learn auto-login and automatic move next algorythm.

These programs are made by refering many other open sources in GitHub :)
